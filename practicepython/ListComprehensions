#Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100,200,201]
evenList=[]

for loopp in a:
  if(loopp%2==0):
    evenList.append(loopp)
print(evenList)
